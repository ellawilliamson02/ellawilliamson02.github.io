        <h1>Didot vs. Bodoni </h1>
             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3>Didot</h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>
				Didot was created in 1783 and published in 1784 by Firmin Didot and later perfected by Giambattista Bodoni. Both of these designers are known as the fathers of the Didone typography movement. Didot is often known as the first Modern typeface. Firmin Didot kept making changes before he died, so he never was able to finish. This typeface is also known for high stroke contrast, condensed armature hairline strokes, vertical stress and flat, unbracketed serifs. Didot is also unsuitable for body text because of its extreme contrast. It is often used for larger signage or displays and can be seen on the cover of Vogue.

			 <h3>Bodoni</h3> <!-- Second typeface here. -->

             <p>
				Giambattista Bodoni first created this typeface in 1798, but it was later taken up by Firmin Didot. It is known for its extreme contrast using fine serifs and extremely perpendicular nature. At this point in time it became known as the “modern serif” and was the new standard for elegance in typography. The typeface has consistency with a common base. The letters are also very clear. This typeface can be found in Valentino, Armani, Dior, Calvin Kleoin, and Elle's branding. In the music industry it can be found in a variety of album covers, including ones by Bruce Springsteen, Nirvana, and Lady Gaga.It is a classic example of a roman typeface, which is recognized as Italian. There are many different styles of Bodini. Bauer Bodoni is better for fine print, whereas FF Bodoni and Bodoni XT create more of a stylized look and are less legible in small text.
